## Justification
Kevin's role was primarily the database and all interactions with it through the application. This involved designing the structure and creating sql scripts to both create the database and populate it with test data. This also included a significant programming role as the application interacts with the database consistently throughout its usage. Jackson's role was primarily creating the application itself. This involved designing the user interface and creating all necessary pages and display areas, along with implementing the functionality for operations the user can perform.
