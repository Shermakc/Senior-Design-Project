## Project Abstract
MediStore Manager is an application to be used by medical supply stores to help manage their inventory. It is designed to be able to be used without any knowledge of the database structure and to provide a smooth workflow for day-to-day operations. Equipment, patients, and suppliers will be stored within the custom database along with all relevant information. The user can view and update this information, along with adding new equipment, patients, or suppliers. They may also print work or order tickets through this application as needed. The application will also allow the user to track any item, patient, or supplierâ€™s prior history with the store.
