## Project Focus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project will consist of creating a front end and back end for a database management softwware design to be used by medical supply stores.
The back end of the software will be split into two parts: the database and the code that interacts with the database. The database will include tables
for all of the items that are necessary to track for daily operations. These include patient information, patient history, rental equipment, parts inventory, and supplier information.
The back end code will perform CRUD operations on the database based on inputs received from the front end of the software.
The front end of the software will display a few different tabs that users will be able to switch between to manage different areas of operation.
These can include Patients, Inventory, and Suppliers. Each tab will allow the user to view and manage the current records in the database as well as create new records.
There will also be sections to create work tickets for the service crew and order tickets for new inventory. These will likely be housed in the Patients and Inventory tabs respectively.

## Project Roles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development roles for the team will be divided between the front end and back end of the project. Jackson will primarily work on developing and testing 
the front end of the software and Kevin will primarily work on developing and testing the back end of the software and managing the database. There will be flexibility in the roles for 
both members to work outside of their primary role if the need arises.
