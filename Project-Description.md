## Project Abstract
MediStore Manager is an application for medical supply stores to manage daily operations. It is designed to be used without any knowledge of the database structure. Inventory, patient, and supplier information will be stored within the database. The user can view and update this information, as well as add new entries. They may also print work or order tickets through the application.
